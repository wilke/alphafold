# Work Summary Report - AlphaFold Split Pipeline Testing

**Date:** 2025-08-07  
**Project:** AlphaFold Split Pipeline  
**Duration:** 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-07  

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Repository Cleanup and Organization
- Removed obsolete test files and scripts created during development
- Reorganized production-ready Apptainer definitions into `docker/` directory
- Git-aware file operations ensuring version control integrity
- Created comprehensive documentation (`APPTAINER.md`) for building and running AlphaFold with Apptainer

### 2. Production Apptainer Definitions
- **Ubuntu 20.04 Definition** (`docker/alphafold_ubuntu20.def`): Production-ready, proven stable on H100 GPUs
  - Successfully passed all tests with CPU relaxation
  - Resolves H100 OpenMM compatibility issues
  
- **Ubuntu 22.04 Definition** (`docker/alphafold_ubuntu22.def`): New definition with CUDNN fixes
  - Fixed CUDNN initialization errors through explicit package installation
  - Added symlink creation for JAX compatibility
  - Uses `cudnn8-devel` base image for proper headers

### 3. Split Pipeline Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_split_pipeline.sh`)
  - Uses real protein sequences from PDB database
  - Monitors GPU, CPU, and memory usage during tests
  - Generates performance reports and scaling analysis
  
- Developed test sequence documentation (`split_pipeline_test_sequences.md`)
  - Real proteins: Villin (35aa), Ubiquitin (76aa), Lysozyme (129aa), Myoglobin (153aa)
  - Provides expected performance metrics by protein size
  - Includes test categories: quick validation, standard testing, performance testing

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with H100 GPU findings and split pipeline guidance
- Removed outdated scripts: `run_alphafold_apptainer.sh` (referenced non-existent files)
- Created new test script: `docker/test_alphafold_container.sh` with H100 auto-detection

## Work in Progress

### Split Pipeline Performance Testing
- Ready to execute `test_split_pipeline.sh` for performance metrics collection
- Will validate:
  - Resource utilization scaling with protein size
  - Robustness (interrupt/resume capabilities)
  - Parallel preprocessing effectiveness
  - GPU memory requirements by sequence length

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified/Created
1. `docker/alphafold_ubuntu20.def` - Production Ubuntu 20.04 definition
2. `docker/alphafold_ubuntu22.def` - New Ubuntu 22.04 definition with CUDNN fixes
3. `APPTAINER.md` - Comprehensive Apptainer usage guide
4. `test_split_pipeline.sh` - Split pipeline test runner
5. `split_pipeline_test_sequences.md` - Real protein test sequences
6. `docker/test_alphafold_container.sh` - Container validation script

### Files Deleted
- Obsolete test definitions moved to archive
- Removed `run_alphafold_apptainer.sh` (outdated references)
- Cleaned up temporary test scripts

### Key Functions Added
- `start_monitoring()` / `stop_monitoring()` - Resource usage tracking (test_split_pipeline.sh:59-95)
- `run_preprocessing()` - Preprocessing with metrics collection (test_split_pipeline.sh:98-179)
- `run_inference()` - Inference with GPU monitoring (test_split_pipeline.sh:182-247)
- `analyze_results()` - Performance report generation (test_split_pipeline.sh:266-355)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Split Pipeline Tests**
   - Run `test_split_pipeline.sh` with real protein sequences
   - Collect performance scaling data (O(L) preprocessing, O(LÂ²) inference)
   - Validate robustness scenarios

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyze scaling metrics vs protein length
   - Document optimal resource allocation strategies
   - Create performance tuning recommendations

3. **Final Integration**
   - Commit all changes to git
   - Push updates or create PR as requested
   - Update upstream documentation if needed

## Key Findings

### H100 GPU Compatibility
- OpenMM lacks sm_90 architecture support (H100)
- Solution: Use `--use_gpu_relax=false` for CPU-based relaxation
- No impact on prediction quality, minor performance difference

### Ubuntu 22.04 CUDNN Issues
- JAX requires specific CUDNN symlinks not created by default
- Fixed by explicit symlink creation in definition file
- Requires `cudnn8-devel` base image for proper headers

### Split Pipeline Benefits
- Preprocessing (CPU-intensive) can run on CPU nodes
- Inference (GPU-intensive) can be batched on GPU nodes
- Features cached as `features.pkl` for reuse
- Enables parallel preprocessing of multiple sequences
